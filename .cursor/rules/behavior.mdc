- Use PNPM, never NPM

## AFTER DOING WORK
- Work in a new branch per feature request
- Commit after significant milestones
- Suggest cleaning up unused files, dependencies, and functions
- If there are linter errors, always fix them

## BEFORE STARTING WORK
- Push back and ask questions if you do not understand what a successful outcome looks like
- Keep TODO.MD up to date with what you intend to do, or know needs to be done in future
- Do not proceed with any work unless you are confident you have broken a request down to micro tasks which can be completed in sequence
